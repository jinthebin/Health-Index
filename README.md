# Health Across the UK - 2015-2021 Web App

## Streamlit based app for visualizing ONS data around health indicators, combined to provide health indices across 3 domains and multiple-sub-domains.

This is a work-in-progress, and has a number of experimental features. Kindly refer to source data where statistical precision is necessary. Some data files have been locally transformed, as web-scrapping from ONS is currently a feature in development.
